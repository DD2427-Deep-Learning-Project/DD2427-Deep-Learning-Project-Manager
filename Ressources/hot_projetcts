# Neural Style
This is a torch implementation of the paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic
Style by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge.

The paper presents an algorithm for combining the content of one image with
the style of another image using convolutional neural networks. Here's an
example that maps the artistic style of The Starry Night onto a night-time
photograph of the Stanford campus
